# Hakluyt-Narrative-Mapping

This repository holds an example dataset from Richard Hakluyt's [The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques, and Discoveries of The English Nation, Vol. XII., America, Part I.](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/13605/pg13605-images.html)

The dataset is then mapped onto a Leaflet web map with CartoDB base layer.
